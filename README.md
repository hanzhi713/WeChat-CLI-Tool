## WeChat Command-Line Tool
#### Execute main.py, scan the QR code to login, then you are good to go
#### Dependencies:
##### itchat, opencv-python, numba and primesieve

Though it is ok to use mine, I suggest you to use your own Tuling API key.

If you want to write your own command-line module, please refer to ModuleTemplate.py for details.
